                       muziks
        small and ugly midi playback library

                   code: unic0rn
       idea and testing: Misioslaw


       Greets: bonzaj, Pirx, Preacher, Rrrola,
             wie8, gamedev.pl, pouet.net
            and everyone reading this ;))


- both MIDI-0 and MIDI-1 files are supported
  (just give muziks a pointer to a .mid file)
- it's written entirely in asm, but it is NOT
  heavily optimized. if you need something a bit
  smaller - go ahead, code it
- example source code should be self-explanatory
- example is packed with MEW - you should get much
  smaller file with crinkler
- there are no bugs, only features ;)
